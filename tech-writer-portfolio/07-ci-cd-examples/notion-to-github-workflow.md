# Notion To Github Workflow

## Overview

You'll automate the transfer of documentation from Notion to GitHub. The process keeps content in sync and leverages GitHub's version control. The workflow uses Notion's API to export pages, converts them to Markdown, and uploads them to a GitHub repository.

## Audience

Technical writers, content strategists, and communications teams who use Notion for drafting or collaborating on internal documents can benefit from this workflow. It also suits DevOps engineers responsible for maintaining documentation pipelines.

## Objective

The objective is to provide a seamless path for moving content from Notion to GitHub with minimal manual effort. By automating this process, teams can consolidate documentation, reduce inconsistencies, and simplify review cycles.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Single source of truth:** Teams maintain drafts in Notion and push finalized content to GitHub for publication.
- **Migration projects:** Organizations transitioning from Notion to GitHub can migrate historical documents using this workflow.
- **Collaborative editing:** Stakeholders can continue collaborating in Notion while ensuring that the canonical version resides in GitHub.

## Best Practices

1. **Use structured templates in Notion.** Consistent formatting simplifies Markdown conversion.
2. **Tag content for export.** Apply a specific label, such as "Ready for GitHub," to indicate which pages to pull.
3. **Apply linting.** After conversion, run markdownlint and link validation to maintain quality.
4. **Review manually when needed.** Automated conversion may not capture complex formatting perfectly. Schedule manual reviews for high-visibility pages.
5. **Communicate updates.** Notify your team whenever the workflow syncs content, so editors know when GitHub has been updated.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Connect to the Notion API.** Generate an integration token in Notion, then share the desired pages or database with that integration.
2. **Extract page content.** Use a script or open-source tool to fetch the pages you want to transfer.
3. **Convert to Markdown.** If your organization uses specific Markdown flavors, configure the converter accordingly.
4. **Commit the files.** Add the converted Markdown documents to a branch and commit the changes.
5. **Create a pull request.** Open a pull request so reviewers can verify the content before merging to the main branch.

## Detailed Setup

### Prerequisites

- Access to the Notion workspace that contains your documentation.
- Permissions to create integrations in Notion and generate tokens.
- Write access to the target GitHub repository.
- A CI/CD environment, such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps.

### Environment Variables

Store tokens in your CI system's secret manager. For GitHub Actions, define `NOTION_TOKEN` and `DOCS_REPO_TOKEN` in the repository settings. Avoid hardcoding credentials in your workflow files.

### Repository Structure

Organize the Markdown files under a `notion` or `imported` folder within your repository. Keep attachments, such as images, in an `assets` folder. This approach mirrors the structure used in Notion and makes the repository easier to navigate.

## Implementation Steps in Depth

1. **Export pages from Notion.** Use a script that requests the page or database via the Notion API. Retrieve the blocks and parse them into Markdown-compatible format.
2. **Handle rich content.** Notion supports embedded media, callouts, and databases. Decide how to convert these elements. For example, transform callouts into blockquotes and export media files to the `assets` directory.
3. **Normalize formatting.** Standardize headings and tables to match your organization's style guidelines. This step helps maintain consistency once the content is in GitHub.
4. **Version files appropriately.** Include front matter or metadata if your publishing platform requires it. Tag the commit with a meaningful message, such as "Import Notion pages â€“ marketing campaign Q2." 
5. **Open a pull request.** After the script pushes changes to a branch, create a pull request using a bot or an automated tool like `peter-evans/create-pull-request`.
6. **Review, adjust, and merge.** Reviewers inspect the Markdown for accuracy, make minor edits if needed, and merge the pull request when satisfied.

## Security Considerations

Always treat API tokens with care. Use the minimum scope necessary and rotate them periodically. When storing exported data, verify that no private or sensitive information is inadvertently exposed. Keep your workflow dependencies up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.

## Scheduling Strategies

Some teams prefer to run the workflow on a schedule, such as every night, while others trigger it manually or via a webhook. The optimal approach depends on how frequently you update Notion. For high-activity workspaces, an hourly or daily schedule may make sense. For more static content, weekly runs may suffice.

## Onboarding New Teams

When new departments adopt the workflow, provide a concise guide that outlines required permissions, repository structure, and review procedures. Encourage them to run a test export before migrating large volumes of content. Offer a support channel where they can ask questions about Markdown conversion or GitHub usage.

## Maintenance and Monitoring

Check logs frequently to confirm that exports and conversions are running without errors. If the workflow fails, review recent changes to the Notion API or your repository's branching strategy. Keep your scripts well-documented, with comments explaining the purpose of each step. Regular maintenance reduces the risk of stalled exports or outdated documentation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Formatting mismatches:** Some Notion blocks may convert poorly to Markdown. Adjust your parser or handle these blocks manually.
- **Missing images:** Ensure that the script downloads and references images correctly, especially if your Notion pages rely heavily on embedded media.
- **Permission errors:** Verify that your integration token has access to the pages you want to export. If you're using a shared database, double-check sharing settings.

## Example Workflow File

The following GitHub Actions workflow demonstrates how you might automate the process.

```yaml
name: Import Notion Docs
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 1 * * *'
jobs:
  import:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Fetch Notion Pages
        run: python scripts/notion_export.py --token ${{ secrets.NOTION_TOKEN }}
      - name: Convert to Markdown
        run: python scripts/notion_to_md.py
      - name: Commit Changes
        run: |
          git config user.name 'Docs Bot'
          git config user.email 'docs@example.com'
          git add .
          git commit -m 'Automated Notion sync' || echo 'No changes'
          git push origin HEAD:notion-sync
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v5
        with:
          branch: notion-sync
          title: 'Automated Notion Sync'
          body: 'This PR includes updates pulled from Notion.'
```

This example assumes you have scripts in your repository that handle the Notion API calls and Markdown conversion. Customize the schedule and branch names as needed.

## Continuous Improvement

As the workflow proves its value, look for ways to improve it further. For example, integrate a style guide linter to enforce tone and terminology. Add a step that generates a changelog summarizing new or modified pages. Consider posting a summary message to your team's chat tool whenever a sync completes successfully.

## Case Study: Product Team Rollout

A product team at ExampleCorp used Notion extensively for feature design specs and user research. They wanted to migrate this content to GitHub to keep it alongside source code and issue tracking. By implementing the Notion to GitHub workflow, the team established a routine where engineers could review documentation alongside pull requests. Over time, this approach improved the accuracy of product requirements and made it easier to onboard new engineers.

## Future Enhancements

Look ahead to possible enhancements, such as adding metadata tags during conversion or integrating with a translation pipeline. If your organization publishes to multiple platforms, you can extend the script to push to additional targets like a static site generator or an internal wiki. Track these ideas in your backlog and prioritize them based on feedback from documentation users.

## Lessons Learned

During early trials of the workflow, teams discovered that large Notion pages led to significant diff noise in pull requests. To mitigate this issue, break up lengthy pages into smaller segments within Notion. This results in more manageable Markdown files and easier reviews. Additionally, consider excluding internal comment threads from exports if they are not relevant to the final documentation. Striking the right balance between preserving context and keeping the repository concise will improve long-term maintainability.

The project also highlighted the importance of consistent naming conventions. When exporting pages, use clear filenames that reflect the content, such as `2025-roadmap-overview.md` or `design-guidelines.md`. This approach simplifies searches and cross-references within the repository.

## Conclusion

Automating the transfer of Notion content to GitHub offers significant advantages, including better version control, simplified peer review, and consolidated storage. By following the guidelines in this workflow, you can set up a reliable pipeline that captures updates in Notion and publishes them to GitHub without manual copying. Continue iterating on the process as your documentation needs evolve, and gather feedback from users to refine your approach.

By carefully managing each step of the export and conversion process, you can ensure that documentation remains clear and accurate as it moves from Notion to GitHub. Consistent communication with stakeholders and proactive monitoring are key to maintaining a trustworthy documentation pipeline.
Regular audits of the exported content will help identify areas for improvement and ensure that your documentation stays aligned with organizational standards.
