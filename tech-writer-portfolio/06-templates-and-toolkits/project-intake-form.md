# Project Intake Form

## Overview
A project intake form is a standardized document used to collect essential information about proposed projects before they officially begin. By gathering consistent details upfront—such as objectives, stakeholders, timelines, and resource needs—organizations can evaluate project feasibility, prioritize initiatives, and allocate resources effectively. A well-designed intake form also clarifies expectations for project sponsors and teams, reducing confusion and miscommunication during the planning stages.

Many organizations struggle with ad-hoc project requests that lack clarity or sufficient background information. Without a structured process, it’s difficult to compare projects, understand dependencies, and determine which ones align with strategic goals. An intake form addresses these challenges by guiding requesters through the information you need to make informed decisions. It creates a single entry point for proposals, ensuring that no project is considered without the necessary context.

This template provides a foundation for creating or improving your own project intake form. It outlines key questions to ask and explains why each section is important. By customizing the template to suit your organization’s workflow, you can streamline approvals and set projects up for success from the start.

## Audience
- Project Management Office (PMO) or Program Managers
- Department Heads evaluating proposed initiatives
- Team Leads submitting project requests
- Portfolio Managers overseeing resource allocation
- Stakeholders responsible for approving budgets and timelines

## Objective
The objective of this intake form is to gather consistent, accurate information about proposed projects so that decision-makers can review them efficiently. By standardizing the information submitted, the form helps teams compare projects fairly and determine which ones offer the most value. It also clarifies expectations for requesters, prompting them to consider scope, risks, and resource requirements before seeking approval.

A secondary objective is to create a transparent pipeline for project proposals. When everyone uses the same form, it becomes easier to track the status of requests, schedule review meetings, and store documentation. This reduces the likelihood of missed opportunities or misaligned priorities. A standardized intake form also provides historical data for future planning, allowing teams to analyze trends in project types, resource demands, and outcomes.

## Usage Scenarios
1. A department head proposes a new internal system to streamline work processes.
2. A marketing team requests a campaign that requires resources from design and engineering.
3. A client-facing team suggests a custom integration to meet a key customer’s needs.
4. A startup wants to prioritize competing product features to match market demand.
5. A nonprofit organization evaluates grant-funded projects to decide which to pursue.

## Best Practices
- Keep the form concise but comprehensive, focusing on details that influence approval decisions.
- Require requesters to specify measurable objectives so you can evaluate success later.
- Use standardized fields or drop-down menus where possible to ensure consistent data collection.
- Include a section for estimated costs and resources, even if numbers are preliminary.
- Encourage collaboration by providing space for multiple stakeholders to review and sign off.
- Clarify the review process and expected timeline so requesters know when to expect feedback.
- Store completed intake forms in a shared repository to maintain a record of decisions.

A clear and thorough intake form reduces the back-and-forth often required to gather missing information. It also demonstrates professionalism and reinforces a structured approach to project management. Encourage requesters to attach supporting documents such as business cases, mockups, or research data. These attachments help reviewers understand the proposal in context and may expedite the approval process.

While it’s important to gather comprehensive information, avoid making the form so long or complex that it discourages submissions. Focus on the data you truly need to make informed decisions. You can always ask for further details later in the review process if necessary. Providing examples or tooltips can help requesters understand exactly what information you expect in each section.

## Action Steps
1. **Project Overview**
   - Describe the project in a sentence or two. Include the name, purpose, and any background context that helps reviewers understand the request.
2. **Goals and Objectives**
   - Identify the specific outcomes the project aims to achieve. Use measurable goals whenever possible, such as increasing website traffic by a certain percentage or reducing processing time.
3. **Stakeholders and Roles**
   - List key stakeholders, sponsors, and team members who will be involved. Specify their roles, such as project manager, subject matter expert, or external partner.
4. **Timeline and Milestones**
   - Provide an estimated start date, major milestones, and target completion date. This helps reviewers assess whether the timeline is realistic and aligns with other priorities.
5. **Budget and Resources**
   - Outline the projected budget, including any required funding, staff hours, or equipment. Mention if external vendors or contractors will be needed.
6. **Scope and Deliverables**
   - Summarize the main deliverables and any known constraints. Clarify what is in scope and, if applicable, what is explicitly out of scope to manage expectations.
7. **Risks and Dependencies**
   - Identify potential risks that could impact the project, along with dependencies on other teams or initiatives. Understanding these factors helps reviewers plan for contingencies.
8. **Success Metrics**
   - Explain how success will be measured. Include key performance indicators (KPIs) or benchmarks. This encourages requesters to think about outcomes rather than just outputs.
9. **Approval Requirements**
   - Outline who needs to approve the project before it can move forward. Include space for electronic signatures or a link to a digital approval system.
10. **Supporting Documents**
    - Provide a section where requesters can attach relevant documents or links. Encourage them to include any research, user feedback, or design mockups that support the request.

### Workflow Integration
Integrate the intake form with your existing project management or ticketing system. This integration ensures that once a form is submitted, the information flows seamlessly into your planning tools. Use automated notifications to alert reviewers when a new form is ready for evaluation. Clearly define who reviews the form first—whether it’s the PMO, department head, or another authority—and set expectations for response time.

If possible, track the status of each request within the system so requesters can see whether it is under review, approved, or rejected. Transparency reduces confusion and minimizes follow-up emails asking for updates. Consider setting up a dashboard that displays all incoming requests, their status, and key dates. This helps leadership prioritize work based on available resources and strategic objectives.

### Communicating Decisions
After reviewing a project intake form, communicate decisions promptly. If the project is approved, outline the next steps and assign a project manager. If it’s rejected or deferred, provide a clear explanation so the requester understands why. Sometimes a project may be valuable but not feasible due to timing, budget constraints, or conflicting priorities. Honest feedback helps teams refine their ideas and potentially resubmit in the future.

### Continuous Improvement
Over time, analyze trends in your project intake submissions. Are there certain departments or teams that frequently submit projects? Are there recurring themes or resource bottlenecks? Use this information to refine your process, adjust the intake form questions, or provide additional guidance to requesters. Regularly reviewing metrics such as approval rates, average review time, and project success rates will help you identify areas where the intake process can be improved.

### Final Thoughts
A well-designed project intake form is crucial for maintaining order and clarity as new initiatives compete for attention and resources. By standardizing the submission process, you make it easier to evaluate proposals, align them with strategic goals, and allocate resources wisely. Use this template as a starting point, adapt it to your organization’s needs, and revisit it periodically to ensure it continues to serve its purpose effectively.

### Example Use Case
Consider a scenario where the marketing department wants to launch a regional advertising campaign. By using the intake form, the team can outline the campaign’s objectives, target markets, budget estimates, and resource requirements. They can also specify dependencies on the design team and external agencies. Reviewers quickly see whether the proposed campaign aligns with current priorities and if sufficient resources are available. The intake form becomes a living document that informs planning meetings and ensures that the project is formally approved before work begins.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Incomplete Details:** Leaving out essential information—such as timeline estimates or key stakeholders—slows down the review process. Always encourage requesters to fill out every section thoroughly.
- **Vague Objectives:** Goals that are too general make it difficult to measure success. Remind requesters to provide specific, measurable objectives so that progress can be tracked.
- **Ignoring Dependencies:** Failing to identify related projects or required approvals can lead to delays later. Encourage teams to think critically about what must happen first and how their project fits into the bigger picture.
- **Skipping Updates:** Once a project is approved, the intake form shouldn’t be forgotten. Update the document as milestones are reached or requirements change, so everyone stays aligned.

By being aware of these common pitfalls, your organization can maintain a smooth intake process that yields useful, actionable data.
