# API Documentation Example

## Overview
A brief sample of how to organize endpoint descriptions, parameters, and response formats.

## Why It Matters
Well-documented APIs enable developers to integrate quickly and reduce support requests.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
Backend developers, integration partners, and technical writers creating API docs.

## Prerequisites
Access to API specification files and working knowledge of HTTP methods.

## Security & Compliance
Avoid exposing private keys in examples. Reference authentication methods without revealing secrets.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Document base URL and authentication steps.
2. Provide endpoint descriptions, request parameters, and sample responses.
3. Include error codes and troubleshooting tips.

## Access Control & Permissions
Share internal API details with trusted partners under NDA. Publish public APIs openly when approved.

## Examples & Templates
✅ Use code blocks for requests and responses with syntax highlighting.
❌ Leave response formats ambiguous or inconsistent.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Out-of-date examples lead to developer frustration. Update docs with each release.

## Tips & Best Practices
Include versioning information and change logs to keep developers informed.

## Troubleshooting
If users report errors, replicate calls with provided examples and verify parameters.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Coordinate with API owners and support teams for bug fixes or design changes.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
Successful integrations with minimal back-and-forth questions.
