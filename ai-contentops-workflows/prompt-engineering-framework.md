# Prompt Engineering Framework

## Overview
A short guide to designing effective prompts for reliable AI outputs.

## Why It Matters
Well-structured prompts produce more consistent and relevant results, saving editing time.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
AI practitioners, technical writers, and analysts experimenting with large language models.

## Prerequisites
Access to a language model and understanding of its capabilities.

## Security & Compliance
Do not include sensitive data in prompts. Follow your organization's data privacy policies.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Define the desired output clearly.
2. Provide context and constraints within the prompt.
3. Test with a small sample and iterate for clarity.
4. Document prompt versions and outcomes for reference.

## Access Control & Permissions
Store prompts in a secure repository with limited edit access. Share read-only examples for training.

## Examples & Templates
✅ Structure prompts with bullet points for clarity.
❌ Rely on vague instructions and expect consistent results.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Models may misinterpret ambiguous terms. Clarify wording and highlight key requirements.

## Tips & Best Practices
Include examples within the prompt and specify the response format.

## Troubleshooting
If outputs vary too much, add constraints or break complex tasks into smaller prompts.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Coordinate with data science teams if adjustments require model fine-tuning.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
Reduced time spent editing and higher satisfaction with AI-generated content.

## Resources & References
Refer to internal style guides and AI research papers on prompt engineering.
