## Overview

This document proposes a modern, secure ContentOps framework for enterprises integrating:

- Agentic AI systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Local fine-tuned LLMs
- CI/CD pipelines for governance and deployment
- Enterprise-level access control and compliance enforcement

The objective is to scale content generation and review without compromising IP, control, or compliance—by merging traditional DevOps principles with content workflows and AI modularity.

---

## Why It Matters

- Enterprises handle sensitive content (internal policies, legal docs, comms).
- Generic SaaS-based LLMs pose data leakage risks.
- Lack of version control, audit trails, and structure in content workflows creates chaos.
- AI output must be consistent, explainable, and trackable—especially in regulated domains.

---

## Audience, Scope & Personas

| Role | Need |
|------|------|
| Technical Writers | Structured content generation, version control |
| AI/ML Engineers | Secure LLM deployment and fine-tuning |
| Change Managers | Controlled rollout of AI tools with adoption tracking |
| Compliance Teams | Audit logs, traceability, red flag triggers |
| Developers | DevOps-style CI/CD for content infrastructure |

---

## Prerequisites

- Git-based documentation repo (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- Dockerized or VPC-contained LLM deployment (e.g., Ollama, Nvidia NIM)
- Flowise, LangChain, or CrewAI for agent orchestration
- Vector store (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant) for RAG
- YAML-first metadata strategy
- RBAC controls (via IAM or API key management)

---

## Security, Compliance & Privacy

- Local LLM instances ensure IP does not leave the network
- Content review and publishing must follow an approval workflow
- Logging of AI outputs and human overrides
- API access to models behind VPN or private cloud
- All content traceable to source, prompt, and version

---

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions

### ✅ Setting up the secure local LLM pipeline
- Containerize the model (Ollama, LM Studio, NVIDIA NIM)
- Implement system prompts enforcing role and tone control
- Use LangChain/CrewAI to wrap the model in a modular reasoning agent

### ✅ Enabling RAG with controlled context
- Inject approved docs into FAISS (not public APIs)
- Apply filters for department, sensitivity level, and access policy
- Retrieval context capped and logged per query

### ✅ Automating content pipelines with CI/CD
- GitHub Actions to lint, validate, and deploy Markdown to Confluence, GitBook, or internal CMS
- PRs trigger AI review (Soothsayer-like agent), comments logged
- Audit logs pushed to Splunk/SIEM

### ✅ Integrating Agents for modular content generation
- Agent 1: Clarifier (ask questions if input unclear)
- Agent 2: Formatter (convert into markdown or HTML structure)
- Agent 3: Reviewer (enforce style guide, flag risk language)
- Agent 4: Publisher (push to Git, CMS, Slack)

---

## Access Control & Permissions

- Writers can initiate, review, and push to staging
- Compliance reviewers required for production merge
- AI agent access keys scoped by department
- Versioned access to all generated drafts

---

## Practical Examples & Templates

✅ `soothsayer-agent.yaml`: Defines behavior of internal agent  
✅ `contentops-pipeline.yml`: GitHub Actions pipeline for staging + approval  
✅ `docs_manifest.yml`: Source of truth for document lifecycle tracking  

❌ Public API calls to OpenAI or Anthropic for regulated content  
❌ LLMs trained or fine-tuned using real customer data

---

## Known Issues & Friction Points

- Internal LLMs require infra investment (GPU, RAM)
- Agents must be explicitly scoped to avoid hallucinations
- Human resistance to automated review must be managed
- CI/CD pipelines for docs still emerging as best practice

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- Fine-tune models on internal tone/style guides only
- Keep agents composable, not monolithic (one job per agent)
- Use commit messages as audit hooks ("Generated by Soothsayer v0.4 with context X")
- Treat prompts as code—version and review them

---

## Troubleshooting Guidance

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Inconsistent AI output | Unscoped prompts | Use stricter base prompts and logs |
| Hallucinations in sensitive content | No RAG or outdated vector index | Refresh index, validate source |
| Publishing failure | GitHub Action misconfigured | Check token, path, and syntax |

---

## Dependencies, Risks & Escalation Path

- Risk: Unauthorized access to local LLM endpoint  
  → Mitigate with VPN, IP whitelisting  
- Risk: Compliance breach through hallucinated content  
  → Mitigate via enforced approval gates  
- Escalation: AI/Infra team → Security team → Governance council

---

## Success Metrics & Outcomes

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to publish approved content | < 2 hours |
| AI-generated content with <5% manual rewrites | 80% of cases |
| Compliance flags caught pre-publish | 100% |
| Team adoption rate | 90% within 3 months |
