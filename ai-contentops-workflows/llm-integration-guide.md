## Overview
Steps for incorporating large language models into existing content workflows with minimal disruption.

## Why It Matters
Integrating LLMs effectively can accelerate production while preserving quality and security.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
Engineers, content leads, and automation specialists connecting AI services to publishing pipelines.

## Prerequisites
Knowledge of API endpoints, authentication, and your content management system.

## Security & Compliance
Use encrypted connections and store API keys in a secrets manager. Follow data privacy regulations.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Identify key content tasks suited for automation.
2. Configure API authentication securely.
3. Map model outputs to your content formats.
4. Implement monitoring to track usage and errors.

## Access Control & Permissions
Restrict API credentials to authorized service accounts. Log access for auditing.

## Examples & Templates
