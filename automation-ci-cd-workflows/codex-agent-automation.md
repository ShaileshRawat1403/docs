# Codex Agent Automation

## Overview
A short overview of automating documentation tasks using the Codex agent within CI pipelines.

## Why It Matters
Codex streamlines repetitive tasks such as formatting and link checking, ensuring consistent quality.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
CI engineers and technical writers integrating Codex into their workflows.

## Prerequisites
A working Codex installation and access to the repository where documentation lives.

## Security & Compliance
Run the agent with limited permissions and avoid exposing tokens in logs.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Configure the agent in your CI workflow file.
2. Provide the necessary input directory and output targets.
3. Review the agent's output and address any reported issues.

## Access Control & Permissions
Only maintainers should update the agent configuration. Logs should be read-only for most users.

## Examples & Templates
✅ Automate style checks with Codex before merging.
❌ Allow the agent to push directly to production without review.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Long-running jobs can delay builds. Optimize configuration for faster feedback.

## Tips & Best Practices
Keep agent tasks focused on quality checks to avoid overloading pipelines.

## Troubleshooting
If the agent fails, review logs and rerun locally with verbose output.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Reach out to the Codex support team for persistent issues or feature requests.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
More consistent documentation and fewer manual corrections.
