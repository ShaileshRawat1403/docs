# Documentation Build Pipeline

## Overview
Explains how to automate documentation builds, including HTML and PDF outputs.

## Why It Matters
Automated builds ensure documentation stays current with source code and reduces manual publishing tasks.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
Technical writers and DevOps teams responsible for release documentation.

## Prerequisites
Access to build tools such as Pandoc or Sphinx, and a CI environment.

## Security & Compliance
Store build artifacts securely. Verify that sensitive information is not unintentionally published.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Configure the build tool to generate desired formats.
2. Run the build in a CI job triggered by commits.
3. Publish artifacts to a repository or website after successful builds.

## Access Control & Permissions
Only maintainers should modify build scripts. Provide read access to published outputs for the wider team.

## Examples & Templates
✅ Use version tags to ensure builds match releases.
❌ Publish drafts as final without review.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Dependency changes can break builds. Pin versions and run tests before deployment.

## Tips & Best Practices
Cache dependencies to speed up builds and reduce network failures.

## Troubleshooting
Check log files when builds fail and rerun with verbose output for more clues.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Coordinate with release managers when docs must align with new software versions.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
Reliable documentation builds that match product releases.

## Resources & References
CI workflow templates and tool documentation.
