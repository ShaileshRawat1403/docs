# Test Prompts

The following prompts intentionally violate different stages of the Prompt Thinking Loop.
Each example includes the expected stage that fails and a short explanation.

1. **"Help?"**
   - *Fails:* Ideate
   - *Reason:* The request is too short and lacks a clear goal.

2. **"Write something."**
   - *Fails:* Investigate
   - *Reason:* There is no background or research context provided.

3. **"Create a report."**
   - *Fails:* Iterate
   - *Reason:* No mention of revision or refinement steps.

4. **"Can you check if this makes sense?"**
   - *Fails:* Create
   - *Reason:* The prompt does not specify a tangible deliverable.

5. **"Tell me about research methods?"**
   - *Fails:* Iterate and Create
   - *Reason:* It includes investigation but lacks iteration cues and deliverable instructions.
