# Business Process Mapping

## Overview
This guide explains how to visualize workflows to identify gaps and streamline operations.

## Why It Matters
Process mapping reveals inefficiencies and improves communication across teams by providing a shared reference.

## Audience, Scope & Personas
Business analysts, process owners, and operations managers use mapping to document current and future states.

## Prerequisites
Collect existing procedures, role definitions, and high-level goals.

## Security & Compliance
Ensure diagrams do not expose confidential data. Keep flowcharts within secure documentation repositories.

## Tasks & Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Define the scope of the process.
2. Interview stakeholders to capture tasks and decisions.
3. Draft a flowchart using standard symbols.
4. Validate with the team and adjust as needed.

## Access Control & Permissions
Restrict editing to team leads. Provide read access for all involved departments.

## Examples & Templates
✅ Keep symbols consistent.
❌ Skip decision points.

## Known Issues & Friction Points
Large processes may overwhelm new team members. Break them into sub-flows for clarity.

## Tips & Best Practices
Focus on user impact. Use a legend to explain symbols.

## Troubleshooting
If the process seems circular, check for missing exit criteria or redundant steps.

## Dependencies & Escalation
Coordinate with quality assurance and IT for systems involved. Escalate to management if process gaps block delivery.

## Success Metrics & Outcomes
Clear diagrams lead to improved efficiency and easier onboarding.

## Resources & References
Refer to BPMN standards and internal process libraries.
